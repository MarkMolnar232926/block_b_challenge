        <h1>Generative AI Challenge: 2D Game Asset Generation</h1>
        <p>In this documentation, I will walk you through our team’s work on the Week 9 &amp; 10 Challenge in Block B. Let’s get started!</p>
        <p>The target of the challenge was to fine-tune a <span class="highlight">Stable Diffusion</span> model to generate game assets, such as items, characters, and objects. But what are Diffusion Models? Diffusion Models are advanced generative models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. They learn from data during training and generate similar examples effectively. These models corrupt training data with Gaussian noise during forward diffusion, then learn to recover the original information through reverse diffusion. Post-training, they generate new data by sampling noise and denoising it.</p>
        <p>We have used a method called <span class="highlight">DreamBooth</span> for Fine-Tuning <span class="highlight">Stable Diffusion</span>. It is called DreamBooth because "It's like a photo booth but captures the subject in a way that allows it to be synthesized wherever your dreams take you." DreamBooth requires only a few (typically 3-5) images of the subject to train the model effectively. Once trained, the model can place the subject in a myriad of settings, scenes, and poses, limited only by the user's imagination.</p>
        <p>With this method, we have created a game asset containing different themed maps such as deserts, jungles, and cities. Additionally, we have created different types of characters like a Mage, an Assassin, an Orc, and a Viking.</p>
        <p>We aimed to have the best-fitted maps and characters that matched our vision, so we had to test and create images multiple times. After creating numerous images, we chose the best-suited ones for our game, which is mainly themed around pixel art. You can see the results at the bottom!</p>
